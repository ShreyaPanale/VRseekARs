We all have had days when we walk for hours and hours in bustling marketplaces visiting different shops and coming out rather unimpressed. We want to provide a convenient way of experiencing luxury shopping amidst the pandemic, through our prototype. Our product uses a simple Augmented Reality scanning camera app to create an AR visual where you get a peek-through into the stores, what it has to offer.
Each shop can place qr codes to scan outside their respective shops and if the user chooses to scan it, details such as the name, location, ratings of the store, and the finest products available will pop up. This will help reduce the crowd inside the store, hence contributing towards social distancing.

# AIM : 
To provide better customer satisfaction, which will increase shopping in physical stores rather than ordering online, which also helps the small businesses in such difficult economic times
By showing the number of people inside the shop at any given time, user can decide if itâ€™s too crowded at the moment and hence shop somewhere else and come back
This will help decrease crowd, increase customer satisfaction, customers feel like visiting the shop again.
